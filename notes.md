# September Notes
##  Headers
    Headers have a pound symbol before them. Each following pound makes a smaller header. You can have up to six.
## Styling Text
    If you want your text to be bold you add two stars or two underscore before and after. **bold**
    Italic text is just one star or underscore. *italic*
    Two tildas is a strike through. ~~I'll never use that though.~~
    You can next italic inside your bold by doing the single underscore around the italizied words in a bold section. **like _this_!**
    But if you are feeling extra you can do three stars and do both italic and bold. ***you gotta BAT CHOU EIEYS!!! LIKE DISS***
    Believe it or not <sub> subscript </sub> and <sup> superscript </sup> work very similar and simply have sub and sup with the greater/less than symbols and a / before the closing one.
## Quoting Text
    The less than sign makes quotes.
